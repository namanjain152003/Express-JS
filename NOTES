EXPRESS JS:

express js is a javascript framework that is used to create backend.

node js is the run time environment which helps to run javascript on any computer

node js + express = backend
it helps to:
1. increase readability
2. less code
3. can add middlewares

express js is very popular now

STEPS TO CREATE EXPRESS SERVER
1. open directory in which u have to work.
2. create index.js in that directory
3. open terminal and create package.json (npm init -y)
4. install express npm (npm i express)
5. now u can work


localhost : when we dont have server on internet but we have to host our server locally . making our own computer as the server of our backend
e.g https://localhost:3000



port is like a door to enter our local system server
3000 is port here

press cntrl + c to stop the server in the terminal 

netsat-ano|findstr"LISTENING" is used to check which ports in the system are listening for windows 

" netstat -tulnp | grep LISTEN " is used to check on github 


 HTTP request

hypertext transfer protocol
it is used to make connection between client and server


Request Vocab:
Get : request resource from server.
Post : Sending the resource to the server.
Put : Replace resource (it completely replace the resource)
Patch : patch up a resource(it only corrects the error part of the resource)
Delete : delete the resource

we can install nodemon which help in detect changes in the server and apply it without clsoing and restarting it
npm i -g nodemon (-g because we download it globally)

Express is used so that when a client performs some action, the client gets a proper result or message in return.
Correct! Express handles requests from the client and sends back appropriate responses.
